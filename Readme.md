## Code Overview

- **Turtle Setup**: The turtles are assigned different colors and start from their initial positions.
- **Random Movement**: Each turtle moves forward by a random number of steps (between 0 and 10).
- **Winning Logic**: The game checks if any turtle crosses the finish line and announces the winner.

## Libraries Used

- `turtle`: Used for graphics and creating the game animation.
- `random`: Used to generate random numbers for turtle movements.

## Customization

You can tweak the game to make it even more fun:
- **Add More Turtles**: Add new colors to the `colors` list and update their positions in `y_position`.
- **Change Canvas Size**: Update the `canvas_width` and `canvas_height` variables to resize the game area.
